Working on the code for a few days now. 

I am able to do every operation except show transaction details of a specific account, adding
 the interest to the account and withdrawing from account. However, I feel my logic is correct.
 Please check the code for the features not working.
 I have been trying to troubleshoot the problems for quite a few hours now. It shows "segmentation error,  core dumped" error.

Attached are the screenshots of the code working as a pdf

Thanks for the good teaching!
